algorithm for reverse string:


save the string in str

load the address of string in t4

start a loop to count the number of characters in the string
store the count in t2
and advance the string pointer

another loop to get reverse string address

reverse string loop: 
    use the count from t2 to use as condition 


t4 = ANSH
t5 = HSNA

iterations:
t4= H 
t5= H 

t3=S 
t5=HS
